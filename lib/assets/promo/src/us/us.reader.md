# [.reader] Reader
{{parent: us}}

A requirements reader uses requirements in his day to day work as an input for other project activities or participates in the requirements review process.

## Chose a presentation format

As a reader, I want to get requirements in a particular document format (PDF, Html, MS Word, OpenDocument, etc.), so that I can use my usual tools to work with the document.
