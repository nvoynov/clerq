# Introduction
{{

}}

## Purpose
{{
skip_meta: true
}}

The purpose of this document is to provide a demo project "Clerq Promo SRS" for all perspective Clerq users to introduce the system by example and provide a sandbox for experiments for the existing users.

The other purpose (rather technical) is to have repository that provides all possible combinations of markup inside (links, ids, macros, etc.) to exercise in writing documents templates.

## Scope
{{
skip_meta: true
}}

This software system will be a command-line interface (CLI) that provides a set of tools related to requirements management tasks. The system will also provide the requirements repository structure and the format of the requirements sources.

The system does not provide any graphical user interface. Assumed that users create and write requirements through any available text editor application, and manage requirements repository structure through any available file manager application.

Any features related to restricting access to the requirements repository or to the functions of the system are out of scope. Assumed that each project repository is under control of an SCM tool (Git, Subversion, etc.) and the SCM is in charge of user's access to the SCM artifacts.

## Overview
{{
skip_meta: true
}}

The remaining sections of this document provide user requirements and functional requirements of the system.

The next chapter [[us]] introduces the system from User Stories' point of view and establishes the context for the functional requirements. The chapter is organized by user roles.

The following chapter [[fr]] describes detailed requirements for functions and user interfaces that are based on user stories from the previous chapter. The chapter is structured around system components and is written primarily for developers and quality assurance specialists.

# User stories
{{
skip_meta: true
}}

## Reader

A requirements reader uses requirements in his day to day work as an input for other project activities or participates in the requirements review process.

### Presentation format

As a reader, I want to get requirements in a particular document format (PDF, Html, MS Word, OpenDocument, etc.), so that I can use my usual tools to work with the document.

## Writer

A requirements writer / author / developer / analyst

### README, HOW-TO

As a requirements analyst who visits the project promo page, I want to get some introduction to the project and its features, so that I understand how close it meets my needs.

{{@@skip it just requires that the project should have README.md}}

### Write in plain text files

As a requirements writer, I want to develop and store requirements in plain text, so that my readers and I would not need to install any specialized software to work with requirements.

### Using of lightweight markup language

As a requirements writer, when I work on the requirements text, I want to use a lightweight markup language (LML), so that it still plain text and, at the same time, I have basic formatting capabilities of style and structure of a text, lists, and tables.

### Set of separate files

As a requirements writer, when I develop requirements, I want to structure the entire set of requirements as a set of separate files and folders, so that I have a high degree of agility but some drawbacks also ...

* I can write different complex topics in different files and folders;
* I can share the same repository with other authors without  problems like the necessity to work with the same file simultaneously more that one person:

{{@@skip just curious if the user stories format really suited there for ... these rather features and benefits or quality properties than stories}}

### Requirements subordination and order

As a drawback for the previous story when I have requirements in separated files, I need an ability to specify requirements subordination and output order through separated files, so that I can combine all requirements into the consistent repository.

### Supporting Metadata

As a requirements writer, when I develop requirements, I want to mark requirements text by some metadata (source, author, dependencies, etc.), so that I can use the metadata for tagging, searching, selection, referring, etc.

### Supporting Links

As a requirements writer, when I develop requirements, I want to link those with each other through simple references, so that I refer from one requirement to others.

### Requirements templates

As a requirements writer, when I develop requirements, I want to create and use requirements templates, so that I simplify my work, improve productivity and provide basic writing style.

### Checking repository
{{
topic: true
}}

As a requirements writer, I want to check requirements repository for different possible errors, so that I fix the errors and have consistent repository.

Manual files writing and writing in separate files especially can cause the following errors:

* Errors in structure of a requirements file;
* Errors in linking or ordering requirements;
* References that not exist in the repository;
* Duplicates of requirements identifiers.

### Querying requirements

As a requirements writer, at any time, I want to query requirements (based on its attributes such "id", "title", "body", and metadata), so that I can have different subsets of requirements based on my needs.

### Combining into documents

As a requirements writer, at any time, I want to combine requirements to a single consistent requirements specification, so that I can have requirements draft and releases.

### Providing unique identifiers

As a requirements writer, I want to have automatically created unique identifiers for the requirements where it omitted, so that I will always have unique identifiers for all requirements.

### Document templates

As a requirement writer, I want the system support ability to chose different templates for documents, so that I can have templates for different purposes (drafts and releases) and even software products (GitHub Markdown, Gitlab Markdown, Pandoc Markdown to convert to docx, odt, or pdf.)

### Create own document template

As a requirements writer, I want to have ability to create my own templates or modify existing templates, so than I can do template tuning for my needs.

### Script automation

As a requirements analyst, I want have ability to automate my working tasks related to requirements, so that I can write scripts related to publishing, reviewing or deriving other artifacts based on the requirements (backlog, estimation sheet, traceability matrix, etc.).
