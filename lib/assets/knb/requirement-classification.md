% Requirements classification

BABOK

__Business requirements__: statements of goals, objectives, and outcomes that describe why a change has been initiated. They can apply to the whole of an enterprise, a business area, or a specific initiative.

__Stakeholder requirements__: describe the needs of stakeholders that must be met in order to achieve the business requirements. They may serve as a bridge between business and solution requirements

__Solution requirements__ : describe the capabilities and qualities of a solution that meets the stakeholder requirements. They provide the appropriate level of detail to allow for the development and implementation of the solution. Solution requirements can be divided into two sub-categories:

* __functional requirements__: describe the capabilities that a solution must have in terms of the behaviour and information that the solution will manage, and
* __non-functional requirements or quality of service requirements__: do not relate directly to the behaviour of functionality of the solution, but rather describe conditions under which a solution must remain effective or qualities that a solution must have.

__Transition requirements__: describe the capabilities that the solution must have and the conditions the solution must meet to facilitate transition from the current state to the future state, but which are not needed once the change is complete. They are differentiated from other requirements types because they are of a temporary nature. Transition requirements address topics such as data conversion, training, and business continuity.

Stakeholders

Each task includes a list of stakeholders who are likely to participate in the execution of that task or who will be affected by it. A stakeholder is an individual or group that a business analyst is likely to interact with directly or indirectly. Any stakeholder can be a source of requirements, assumptions, or
constraints.

SMART

* Specific: describing something that has an observable outcome,
* Measurable: tracking and measuring the outcome,
* Achievable: testing the feasibility of the effort,
* Relevant: aligning with the enterpriseâ€™s vision, mission, and goals, and
* Time-bounded: defining a time frame that is consistent with the need
