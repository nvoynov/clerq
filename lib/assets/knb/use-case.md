# Fowler

Martin Fowler states "There is no standard way to write the content of a use case, and different formats work well in different cases." He describes "a common style to use" as follows:

* Title: "goal the use case is trying to satisfy"
* Main Success Scenario: numbered list of steps
  * Step: "a simple statement of the interaction between the actor and a system"
* Extensions: separately numbered lists, one per Extension
  * Extension: "a condition that results in different interactions from the main success scenario"
